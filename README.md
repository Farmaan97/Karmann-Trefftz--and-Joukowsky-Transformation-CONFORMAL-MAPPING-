The contents of the files presents us with the conformal transformation of the karmann-Trefftz & Joukowsaky transformation model.
The code has the capability of presenting us with unique airfoil shapes.

To better understand the history of this transofrmation, though now it is rarely used in industries, these transformations laid the foundation of the airfoil profile that
we see being used in most of the application in the aerospace, automobile, defense,renewable (wind/hydro),... and many more industries.
